# Project Workflow
This project currently uses the [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) system of branch management. If you're unfamiliar system, the only bits that regular developers/contributors need to know is that the 'master' branch represents the live, released version of the game, while 'develop' is the in-progress branch containing all completed features/changes. If anyone wants to add a feature or make a change, just create a new branch off develop and work on it there, then once finished use GitHub's Pull Request feature to mark it as ready to merge back into develop (the site may try and request a merge into master by default, you may need to change that manually when creating the pull request).

## Merge Conflicts
The Unity project has been set up to simplify merging branches as much as possible (the Visible Assets mode is enabled to manage asset tracking, and all Unity-generated binary files have been converted to a plaintext YAML format), though if problematic merge conflics occur that cannot be resolved using simple text editing Unity provides a [merge tool](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SmartMerge.html) to simplify the process.
